# Hello World!

### This is the last project within the Frontend course in the Principal33 internship (We love you Marian :heart:).

### This project is a team project and we need to make a portofolio website where we put our CV's, using Frontend (Vue JS) and Backend (.Net).

### The team members are: Emanuela Nimigean, Gabriel Negreanu, Radu Parpalea and Patrick Pacurar.

## Requirements:

- [x] Taskboard on Trello (www.trello.com);
- [x] Daily meetings on Microsoft Teams;
- [x] Two separate Github repositories for frontend part and backend part;
- [x] Each task that we will do will be transformed into pull requests, and other team members will review and test. For this, we will make branch for every task;
- [x] For design, we can use templates (or create by our own) and create a Figma project to implement the wireframes (www.figma.com);
- [x] Login page. When a user is logged in, the website shows the portofolio of that user;
- [x] Database for the users (only team members - 4 users) where the data is stored;
- [x] As guest, I see the login page. If I have an account in database, I can log in and become user (only team members are users);
- [ ] As user logged in, I can update the information about one of my portofolio sections. I can see my colleagues' portofolio, but I can't edit the information.
